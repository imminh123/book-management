# Disclaimer

Thanks Peter for this opportunity, not just for the interview but also for the challenge that I believe I can do much better than this. There're always things to learn even from this test project. Whether or not this meets 3IPKâ€™s standard, I would love to hear your feedback if possible. Have a nice day!

## Improvement

Tbh, thereâ€™s lots of room for improvement with this open task if there is enough effort.
<br/>1. The app has unit test covered for BE (Book module) but not for FE (can be improved with Jest for UT & Cypress for e2e)
<br/>2. Search function
<br/>3. More ways for authentication, I'm going with discord to ease the pain of signing up.
<br/>4. Deployment: I want to save you some time having to dockerize this but sadly my AWS account got suspended for overdue payment (I forgot to terminate a bunch of services so the bill went through the roof). ðŸ˜¢
